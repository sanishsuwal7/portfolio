As the digital landscape evolved, so did my skills ‚Äì from playing games to creating websites with my HTML and CSS abilities.That same drive for creation and design has never left me.
My journey has taken me through various creative and technical realms ‚Äì from making websites to learning about algorithm design and also exploring research landscape in AI field.
I have worked with a variety of technologies, including React, AngularJS, Spring, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS and Docker. 
Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and cooking tasty food. I'm always up for a talk with a great cup of mocha. A food enthusiast at heart, I'm your go-to for the next potluck.I'm eager to connect and collaborate ‚Äì reach out!`;
